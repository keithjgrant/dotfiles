Single home for my various config files for Vim, Git, Zshell, etc.

I got tired of re-doing this or manually copying files whenever I need
to set up a new machine.

USAGE: Clone this repository anywhere you like, then use symlinks
to link to the desired files from their appropriate place (generally
your home folder).
